https://spring.io/tools/sts

##Install
Use STS / Eclipse and choose `file -> import -> Maven -> existing maven projects`.  
Navigate to the root folder where you extracted the project (the folder should have the  `pom.xml` file) 
Once you have the projcet imported, right click the base-folder for the project in the package explorer and choose `run-as -> maven clean`.
Then right click again and choose `run-as -> maven install`.
There should be no compile-errors / markers after this has finished.
When this is done, right-click App.java and choose `run-as -> Java application`.
